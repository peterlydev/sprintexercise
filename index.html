                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 1901 SC Courtraisien was founded. The club merged with FC Courtraisien in 1918. They received in 1951 the name Koninklijke Kortrijk Sport. They had the matricule n°19 like the oldest club SC Courtraisien. Stade Kortrijk was founded in 1923 with matricule n°161. Because Stade Kortrijk and Koninklijke Kortrijk Sport didn't play well anymore, they merged in 1971. They could play with matricule n°19 and the new name was KV Kortrijk. Due to a bankruptcy, KV Kortrijk had to relegate in 2001 to the third division. From 2004 to 2008 KV Kortrijk played in the second division, however in the 2007–08 season they managed to get promoted to the first division. KV Kortrijk was bought for €5 million by Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan on 12 May 2015. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
